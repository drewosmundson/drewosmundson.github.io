      <h2>3D Multiplayer Naval Combat Game</h2>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> JavaScript, Three.js, Node.js, Socket.IO, Express, WebGL</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a real-time 3D multiplayer boat combat game with custom physics, procedural terrain, and water simulation using Three.js and WebGL.</li>
        <li>Engineered a modular Boat class system supporting damage handling, wave-responsive movement, randomized terrain-safe spawn points, and visual feedback for hits and destruction.</li>
        <li>Built a Projectile system with realistic ballistic trajectories, gravity physics, and collision detection against terrain, water, and enemy boats.</li>
        <li>Integrated visual effects such as water splashes, terrain dust impacts, explosions, and particle-based damage indicators to enhance gameplay feedback.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented smooth client-server synchronization using Socket.IO, supporting real-time position, rotation, and damage updates in multiplayer environments.</li>
        <li>Managed game state transitions including player spawn, movement, shooting, and destruction with efficient network messaging and interpolation functions.</li>
        <li>Optimized rendering performance with resource cleanup and conditional scene updates, ensuring memory-efficient gameplay.</li>
        <li>Developed a robust collision detection system to trigger game events and visual effects based on projectile-boat and terrain interactions.</li>
        <li>Employed clean code architecture with component-based game classes (e.g., Boat, Projectile, Terrain, Water, GameManager) for scalability and maintainability.</li>
        <li>Deployed the full stack Node.js application to a live multiplayer server using Render, supporting public web access and real-time interaction.</li>
